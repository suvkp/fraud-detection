# Fraud Detection
# Introduction
Imagine your card gets declined at the grocery store, only to find out it was a false alarm for fraud. While embarrassing, these systems save consumers millions annually. IEEE-CIS, in collaboration with Vesta Corporation, aims to enhance fraud detection accuracy, reducing such hassles.

# Objective
This project benchmarks machine learning models on Vestaâ€™s real-world e-commerce data. By improving fraud detection, we aim to reduce false positives, helping businesses cut fraud losses and boost revenue, while ensuring smoother transactions for consumers.
